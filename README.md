# passGenerator

This project was built using Python. It generates a password and allows you to save it into a SQLite3 Database. Basic operations like deletions can also be performed.

Passwords can be deleted uing the OID which is displayed when a password has been saved.

The GUI was built using Tkinter.

Feel free to suggest any improvements!!

(Ignore The Weird Generation Algorithm!!)
